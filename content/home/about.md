# Biography

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the Faculté de médecine vétérinaire,
Université de Montréal, within the [Canadian Bovine Mastitis and Milk Quality
Research Network](http://www.medvet.umontreal.ca/rcrmb/en/). I'm working on
selection and misclassification bias in longitudinal udder health studies, and
on economics of bovine mastitis.
