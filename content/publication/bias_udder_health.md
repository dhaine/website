Using imperfect tests may lead to biased estimates of disease frequency and of
associations between risk factors and disease. For instance in longitudinal
udder health studies, both quarters at risk and incident intramammary infections
(IMI) can be wrongly identified, resulting in selection and misclassification
bias, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy can possibly be improved by using
duplicate or triplicate samples for identifying quarters at risk and,
subsequently, incident IMI. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the
relative impact of selection and misclassification biases resulting from IMI
misclassification on measures of disease frequency (incidence) and of
association with hypothetical exposures. The effect of improving the sampling
strategy by collecting duplicate or triplicate samples at first or second
sampling was also assessed. Data sets from a hypothetical cohort study were
simulated and analyzed based on a separate scenario for two common mastitis
pathogens representing two distinct prevailing patterns. Staphylococcus aureus,
a relatively uncommon pathogen with a low incidence, is identified with
excellent sensitivity and almost perfect specificity. Coagulase negative
staphylococci (CNS) are more prevalent, with a high incidence, and with milk
bacteriological culture having fair Se but excellent Sp. The generated data sets
for each scenario were emulating a longitudinal cohort study with two milk
samples collected one month apart from each quarter of a random sample of 30
cows/herd, from 100 herds, with a herd-level exposure having a known strength of
association. Incidence of IMI and measure of association with exposure (odds
ratio; OR) were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for each data
set and using different sampling strategies (single, duplicate, triplicate
samples with series or parallel interpretation) for identifying quarters at risk
and incident IMI. For S. aureus biases were small with an observed incidence of
0.29 versus a true incidence of 0.25 IMI/100 quarter-month. In the CNS scenario,
diagnostic errors in the two samples led to important selection (40 IMI/100
quarter-month) and misclassification (23 IMI/100 quarter-month) biases for
estimation of IMI incidence, respectively. These biases were in opposite
direction and therefore the incidence measure obtained using single sampling on
both the first and second test (29 IMI/100 quarter-month) was exactly the true
value. In the S. aureus scenario the OR for association with exposure showed
little bias (observed OR of 3.1 versus true OR of 3.2). The CNS scenario
revealed the presence of a large misclassification bias moving the association
towards the null value (OR of 1.7 versus true OR of 2.6). Little improvement
could be brought using different sampling strategies aiming at improving Se
and/or Sp on first and/or second sampling or using a two out of three
interpretation for IMI definition. Increasing number of samples or tests can
prevent bias in some situations but efforts can be spared by holding to a single
sampling approach in others. When designing longitudinal studies, evaluating
potential biases and best sampling strategy is as critical as the choice of
test.
