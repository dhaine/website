*Staphylococcus aureus* is a bacterial pathogen causing bovine intramammary
infections (IMIs) often leading to chronic clinical or subclinical mastitis.
Predicting the outcome of *S. aureus* IMIs (duration and clinical vs
subclinical) based on the characterization of isolates would help to make better
case management decisions.
For this purpose, 583 *S. aureus* isolates from series of quarter milk samples
were characterized by genotypic tests (detection of virulence genes seg, tst,
lukM), epidemiological typing (spa type) and by a phenotypic test (biofilm
production).
VNTR typing (variable number of tandem repeats) was used to establish
persistence of the same *S. aureus* strain in each series of sequential
isolates.
This allowed to associate each strain to a clinical/subclinical status and to
validate the duration of infection.
We found differences in the distribution of spa types between the strains from
clinical and subclinical cases.
Prevalence of lukM was also higher in strains from clinical cases than in
strains from subclinical cases.
A Kaplan-Meier analysis was then used to determine factors influencing the
duration of the infection.
Considering a multivariable model of the logistic regression, time to
elimination was shorter with the strains of the subclinical lactation series
compared to the clinical series (series with at least one clinical case).
Strains from the spa type t359 and t529 were less likely to persist compared to
those of spa type t13410.
In sum, strain characterization including determination of the spa type helps to
predict duration of infection and the clinical or subclinical outcome of *S.
aureus* IMIs.
