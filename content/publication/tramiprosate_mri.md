Objectives: The efficacy, safety and disease-modification of tramiprosate
(homotaurine) were investigated in a recently completed large-scale Phase III
clinical study in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), the
Alphase study. Disease-modification was assessed using longitudinal volumetric
MRI (vMRI) measurements of the hippocampus in a subgroup of patients. The
present study describes the vMRI, cognitive and clinical results obtained in
this subgroup. Design: Multi-center, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled study in a subset of the 1052 patients of the Alphase study.
Setting: 51 vMRI investigative sites in the United States and Canada.
Participants: A total of 508 patients underwent vMRI scanning. Of these, 312
provided scan pairs for assessing hippocampus volume changes and were included
in the analyses. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive Placebo BID
(n = 109), tramiprosate 100 mg BID (n = 103), or tramiprosate 150 mg BID (n =
100) for 78 weeks. Measurements: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive
subscale (ADAS-cog) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-boxes CDR-SB assessments
were conducted at Baseline and at Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52, 65 and 78. Exploratory
analyses were performed using similar First and Final mixed-effects
repeated-measures models that were used for the analysis of the entire patient
dataset. Results: Psychometric score results showed numerical trends in favour
of tramiprosate that did not reach statistical significance. While there were no
statistically significant group differences in hippocampus volume using the
First modeling approach, a significant dose-response reduction in hippocampus
volume change was found in the Final models. Moreover, there was a marginally
significant overall treatment main effect and a significant slope difference in
favour of tramiprosate according to the Final model analysis of the ADAS-cog
scores. ADAS-cog scores analyzed according to this model also revealed
differences in favor of the tramiprosate 150 mg group at weeks 26 and 52, with
marginally significant differences at Weeks 13 and 39. Slope analyses of
ADAS-cog score changes showed significant differences in favor of the 150 mg BID
group, and when both active groups were combined, in comparison to the placebo
group. No between-group differences with respect to changes to each visit in the
CDR-SB were observed with either modeling approach. Although there was a similar
dose-response relationship observed in the hippocampus volume and ADAS-cog Final
model analyses, the overall changes in psychometric scores and hippocampus
volume were not significantly correlated. Conclusion: Exploratory analysis of
the vMRI subgroup suggests that tramiprosate slows hippocampal atrophy, and
reveals some evidence of a beneficial effect on cognition. The clinical validity
of the vMRI biomarker is discussed.
