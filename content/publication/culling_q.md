The series of events leading to the decision to cull a cow is complex,
involving both individual-level and herd-level factors. While the decision is
guided by financial returns, it is also influenced by social and psychological
factors. Research studies on the motivational and behavioural aspects of
farmers' decision utility are sparse, and nonexistent regarding culling
expectations and its decision process. Our goal was to identify shared criteria
on culling decisions held by dairy producers and farm advisers, with the help of
the Q-methodology. Forty-one dairy producers and 42 advisers (17 veterinarians,
13 feed mill advisers, and 12 dairy herd improvement (DHI) advisers) undertook a
Q-sort with 40 statements that represented a range of views about cow and herd
health, production performance, management issues, and material factors that
might impact their culling decision-making process. The sorts were analysed
by-person using factor analysis and oblimin rotation. A single view on culling
could be identified among dairy producers that can be extended to dairy farm
advisers, who showed two variations of the same well-structured, uni-dimensional
decision-making process. Udder health, milk production performance, and milk
quota management were the key criteria for the culling decision. Farm management
parameters (debts, amortization, employees, milking parlour capacity, herd size)
did not play any role in the decision process. Three key differences were,
however, identified between producers and the two types of advisers. One group
of advisers followed the recommendations from mathematical models, where
pregnancy is a major determinant of a cow's value. They assessed the cow in a
more abstract way than did the other participants, still taking into account
udder health and milk production, but adding economic considerations, like the
availability of financial incentives and an evaluation of the post-partum health
of the cow. Dairy producers were also more concerned about producing healthy and
safe milk, which might reflect a different value given to dairy farming than by
advisers. Very different degrees of importance were given to animal welfare by
the three groups, which could represent different views on the attributed
relationships between dairy farmers and their animals. Our findings suggest that
dairy producers and their advisers hold a general common view regarding culling
decision-making. However there are significant differences between producers and
advisers, and among advisers. Understanding and managing these differences is
important for assisting the change management processes required to increase
farm profitability, and call for further investigation.
