AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of montelukast as add-on therapy for
asthmatic patients who remain uncontrolled with low, moderate or high doses of
inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy. DESIGN: An eight-week, multicentre,
open-label, observational study. RESULTS: Of 320 patients enrolled, 288 (90.0%)
completed the study. Of patients who had uncontrolled asthma symptoms (Canadian
Asthma Consensus Guidelines Update, 2003) but were controlled according to the
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ score of less than 1.5), 93.9% maintained
asthma control at week 8. Of patients with uncontrolled asthma at baseline for
both definitions, 63.5% achieved asthma control by week 8. The mean +/- SD ACQ
score decreased from 1.13+/-0.28 to 0.57+/-0.50 (P<0.001) for controlled
patients at baseline and from 2.38+/-0.73 to 1.03+/-0.80 (P<0.001) for patients
who were uncontrolled at baseline, each representing a clinically significant
improvement. CONCLUSION: Montelukast add-on therapy is an effective alternative
to inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy.
