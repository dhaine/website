My R package [`episensr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=episensr
"episensr") can now also be used through a new Shiny application,
[`episensr_shiny`](https://dhaine.shinyapps.io/episensr_shiny/
"episensr_shiny"), to more easily assess the effect of biases on epidemiological
results.

Not all functions and options are available yet, only `selection` bias and
`misclassification` of exposure or outcome can be specified.
But direct consequences of modifying the bias parameters by moving the sliders
can be checked on the 2-by-2 tables and measures of association.

This is therefore still in "beta" but more will come.
All feedback welcome!
